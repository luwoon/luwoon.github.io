      <h5><br>A data analyst</h5>
      <p>In my current role as a Statistics Senior Executive, I regularly perform data extraction, cleaning, and visualization using IBM Cognos Analytics, SQL, Tableau, and 
         Microsoft Excel, to track operational efficiency and inform policy formulation. I work closely with other staff in the organization, senior management, and local and 
         stakeholders to understand their data requirements and present data findings to them. I have created innovative data solutions by writing SQL scripts and creating 
         management reports and dashboards, cutting manual workload by 75%. I believe my proven skills in working with large datasets and deriving 
         meaningful data insights are transferable to other industries, which I am eager to explore.</p>
      <h5>A musician</h5>
      <p>I am a pianist and a violist. Currently, I am pursuing the Licentiate of Trinity College London (LTCL) diploma qualification for piano, on top of my existing ABRSM Grade 8 qualifications in the piano, viola, and music theory. In my free time, I also perform in various orchestras in Singapore as a member and a guest player on the viola.<br><br>
         Previously, I taught music at Cristofori Music Pte Ltd, and was a freelance piano accompanist.
      </p>
      <h5>An avid reader</h5>
      <p>I love reading during my free time because there is so much freedom in it. The freedom to learn about anything I am intrigued by, the freedom to experience life in any country and any lifestyle that have been written about. At any one time, I would be reading one fiction book and one non-fiction book. Fiction genres I enjoy include thrillers, mystery, historical fiction, and romance. Non-fiction genres I enjoy range from self-improvement and business to philosophy and biographies of inspiring people.</p>
